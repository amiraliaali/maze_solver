## Repository Overview
This repository applies various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to solve a maze problem. The objective, as shown in the GIFs above, is for the agent to find the shortest path from the start to the coins.

### Implemented Algorithms
We have developed a total of 12 RL algorithms, which include:
- Dynamic Programming
- Monte Carlo
- Temporal Difference
- Deep Learning

These algorithms are located in the `scripts/algorithms` directory.

### Maps
We have designed around 5 maps that you can import and run each algorithm on.

### Running from VSCode
We have set up 12 tasks in VSCode, one for each algorithm. You can easily run any algorithm by selecting its corresponding task in VSCode.
